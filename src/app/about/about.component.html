        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
          Sri Lanka Railways was established in 1864 during the British colonial era. The first railway line connected Colombo with Kandy, marking the beginning of a new era in transportation. Over the years, we have expanded our network and modernized our services to meet the growing needs of our passengers.
